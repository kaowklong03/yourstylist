-- Add purchase_info free-text field to ads table.
-- This replaces the destination-URL-only merchant experience with an open
-- plain-text field where merchants can describe their purchase channel.
--
-- BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
--   - destination_url is preserved as a legacy field.
--   - Existing destination_url values are copied into purchase_info where
--     purchase_info is currently null, so legacy ads keep displayable info.
--   - New ads write purchase_info; destination_url is no longer required.
--   - RLS remains unchanged.
--   - The ads table is NOT recreated.

-- 1. Add the column (idempotent via DO block).
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public'
      AND table_name = 'ads'
      AND column_name = 'purchase_info'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE public.ads
      ADD COLUMN purchase_info text NULL;
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 2. Add length constraint (idempotent).
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM pg_constraint
    WHERE conname = 'ads_purchase_info_length_check'
      AND conrelid = 'public.ads'::regclass
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE public.ads
      ADD CONSTRAINT ads_purchase_info_length_check
      CHECK (purchase_info IS NULL OR char_length(purchase_info) <= 500);
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Reject ASCII control characters. PostgreSQL text already rejects null bytes,
-- while this constraint also covers the remaining control range.
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM pg_constraint
    WHERE conname = 'ads_purchase_info_safe_text_check'
      AND conrelid = 'public.ads'::regclass
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE public.ads
      ADD CONSTRAINT ads_purchase_info_safe_text_check
      CHECK (purchase_info IS NULL OR purchase_info !~ '[[:cntrl:]]');
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 3. Copy existing destination_url values into purchase_info for legacy ads
--    that do not yet have a purchase_info value.
--    URLs longer than the new field limit remain readable through the legacy
--    fallback and are not truncated or overwritten.
UPDATE public.ads
SET purchase_info = destination_url
WHERE purchase_info IS NULL
  AND destination_url IS NOT NULL
  AND char_length(destination_url) <= 500;

-- 4. Update the write trigger so purchase_info follows the same moderation
--    boundary as other merchant-authored ad content.
--    The trigger is replaced in full; all other logic is identical to
--    the 20260730221500 migration version.
